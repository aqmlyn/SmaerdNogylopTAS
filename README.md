# Smaerd Nogylop TAS Project

This repository contains TAS files for the mod [Smaerd Nogylop](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150740) for the video game [Celeste](celestegame.com). 
The mod is a copy of the mod [Polygon Dreams](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150729) where each level is designed to be played backwards. Polygon Dreams has a separate TAS project for which the files are located [here](https://github.com/ella-TAS/ella-TAS/tree/main/Polygon-Dreams).

## About

TAS files contain lists of inputs for a program (e.g. libTAS) or physical device (e.g. TASBot) to perform. TAS files for Celeste in particular are written in a custom format for use with the mod [CelesteTAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715), which itself is designed for use with the modloader [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/).

All TASes in this repository have the goal of completing certain objectives on a new file in the least in-game time possible (without using timer overflow) while using cheat mode as little as possible and without using any variants.

## Viewing

TASes from this repository can be viewed either by watching published recordings or by running TAS files on your PC using [CelesteTAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715).

## Contributing

Currently, contributors are encouraged to join the [Smaerd Nogylop TAS Discord server](https://discord.gg/7pXMZPZWkX) and send drafts and improvements through the `#tas-files` channel, as that channel is watched by the [CelesteTAS Improvements Tracker](https://github.com/Kataiser/CelesteTAS-Improvements-Tracker) Discord bot which catches lots of oversights and formatting errors and automatically manages `Contributors.txt`. Since the TAS files in this repository make heavy use of `read` commands, we also recommend using software such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to make it easier to stay up-to-date and avoid desyncs.

Past contributions to this repository's TAS files were passed through Discord DMs to Renatotheflowey and EllaTAS. The contributors mentioned in the 
[Polygon Dreams All Chapters recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDI-0AgMtoc) are listed in `Contributors.txt` alongside contributors from the Discord server linked above.
